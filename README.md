# community-social-media-app
Users report locations certain things, for example, a medical emergency or a traffic jam!
The backend (which I most enjoyed building), is in the following repo:

# About
I just started hacking away at this in my spare time for about 3 months or so and ended up with a semi complete app!
Basically it allows you to login with Facebook, upload posts (with images & coordinates), search posts (by category, location, number of likes), like and comment on posts.

I learnt a lot of react-native while doing this including:
- best ways to upgrade a projects packages (which proves to be hard some times)
- write clean react-native modules
- changing the boilerplate
  + I did this multiple times, in the end it sped up the development process.
- optimize bits of code
- much more...

# What I learnt about react-native
- It's really easy to prototype apps quickly, but when it comes to refining them and adding smaller details, the development time starts to slow down. 
- The styling is quite hard, at first, to get right.
- It's got an amazing community that spends a lot of time improving the codebase everyday!
- Changing react-native versions can prove to be a hard task. Build error, npm package dependcies, and more...

#Must
If you want to run this app you'll need the following frameworks put into the /ios/ folder:
- FBSDKCoreKit.frameworks
- FBSDKLoginKit.framework
- FBSDKShareKit.framework
